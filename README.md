# timer-dnd

A CLI timer utility that helps you stay focused by turning on the Do Not Disturb mode (on macOS).

Inspired by the [mindful-timer](https://github.com/arodik/mindful-timer) project
but implements only the timer functionality (no sessions DB etc.).

# Thanks

To all of the maintainers and contributors of the [mindful-timer](https://github.com/arodik/mindful-timer) project.
